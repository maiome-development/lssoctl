Roadmap
=======

- [ ] Auth and session log management
  - [X] `log:view` - Show individual or all logs in pretty printed JSON
  - [ ] `log:delete` - Delete individual or ranges of logs
  - [ ] `log:clear` - Clear an entire log
- [ ] Session management
  - [X] `session:list` - Show active sessions in the Redis
  - [ ] `session:kill` - Kill a session by ID
  - [ ] `session:info` - View all info for a session, including checkins
- [ ] Token management
  - [ ] `token:create-access` - Create an access token for usage.
  - Requires backend support
    - Other API Tokens (beyond access tokens)?
  - Tokens used for API access, HTTP basic auth, etc. (differ from access tokens?)
- [ ] Status information
  - `status:get` - Simply displays status of LSSO, SSO backend (`/_health` or `/_ping`), Redis
